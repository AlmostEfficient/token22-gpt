# What is this?
A collection of guides/docs on the Token22 standard used as reference docs for AI chatbots. These have been edited to combine code and topical information into specific files.

Taken from the [Solana Token-2022 docs](https://spl.solana.com/token-2022) and the [developer content](https://github.com/solana-foundation/developer-content) repo.


## Get started
[instructions.md](instructions.md) contains the base system instructions for the chatbot. Adjust it as you see fit and make sure you update any file references.

Add or remove files from the `reference-files` folder as needed. The chatbot will reference these files when responding to user queries.
